# Clerk Authentication Integration

This Next.js application has been successfully integrated with Clerk authentication using the latest App Router approach.

## Setup Complete ✅

### 1. Installed Dependencies

-   `@clerk/nextjs` - Latest Clerk Next.js SDK

### 2. Environment Variables

The following environment variables have been configured in `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_cHJvdWQtcmVpbmRlZXItMTQuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_px8rzI4cyZTTjBB6sAmlvI2rmtKvzfX43H2dJyiYRK
```

### 3. Middleware Configuration

-   Created `middleware.ts` with `clerkMiddleware()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`
-   Properly configured matcher to handle routes and API endpoints

### 4. App Layout Integration

-   Wrapped the application with `<ClerkProvider>` in `app/layout.tsx`
-   Updated Navbar to use Clerk authentication components

### 5. Authentication Pages

-   `/sign-in` - Uses Clerk's `<SignIn>` component
-   `/sign-up` - Uses Clerk's `<SignUp>` component
-   `/dashboard` - Protected route demonstrating authentication

## Features Implemented

### Navigation

-   **Signed Out Users**: See "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons
-   **Signed In Users**: See "Dashboard" link and UserButton with profile menu

### Protected Routes

-   Dashboard page (`/dashboard`) is protected and requires authentication
-   Automatic redirect to sign-in page for unauthenticated users

### Authentication Flow

1. Users can sign up or sign in using Clerk's built-in components
2. After authentication, users are redirected to the dashboard
3. The UserButton provides access to profile management and sign-out

## Usage

### Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test Authentication

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Sign Up" to create a new account
3. Complete the sign-up process
4. You'll be redirected to the dashboard
5. Use the UserButton to manage your profile or sign out

### Authentication Status

-   Homepage shows authentication status ("Sign in to access..." vs "✓ Signed in - Full access enabled")
-   Navigation updates based on authentication state
-   Protected routes automatically enforce authentication

## Architecture

This integration follows Clerk's current best practices for Next.js App Router:

-   Uses `clerkMiddleware()` (not the deprecated `authMiddleware()`)
-   Leverages App Router conventions (`app/layout.tsx`, not `_app.tsx`)
-   Implements server-side authentication with `auth()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`
-   Uses Clerk's React components for seamless UI integration

The setup is production-ready and follows all current Clerk documentation guidelines.
